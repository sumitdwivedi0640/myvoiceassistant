voice assistant using python

This is a README file for the Voice Assistant project written in Python. The voice assistant is designed to interact with users through voice commands and perform various tasks based on the given instructions. This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and basic usage information.




## DEPENDENCIES
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

pyttsx3: For speech synthesis, install with pip install pyttsx3.
speech_recognition: For voice recognition, install with pip install SpeechRecognition.
wikipedia: For accessing information from Wikipedia, install with pip install wikipedia.


## USAGE

To use the voice assistant, follow these steps:

1.Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.

2.Clone the repository or download the code.

3.Import the required modules and run the main function.

4.The voice assistant will greet you and listen for your commands.

5.Speak your command clearly and wait for the assistant to process and respond.

6.The assistant can perform various tasks such as searching Wikipedia, opening websites like YouTube and Google, providing the current time, and sending emails.


## CUSTOMIZATIONS

The code can be customized to add more features or modify existing functionality. Here are some suggestions:

1.Adding new commands: To add new commands, you can extend the if-elif logic inside the while loop. Define new conditions based on user input and implement the desired functionality.

2.Integrating additional APIs or services: You can integrate other APIs or services by adding the necessary code inside the appropriate condition. For example, you can use different search engines or web APIs to perform searches or retrieve information.

3.Modifying speech output: To change the voice or speech characteristics, modify the properties of the engine object in the speak function. You can experiment with different voices or adjust the speech rate and volume.

4.Enhancing error handling: If the voice recognition encounters an error or the assistant fails to perform a task, you can implement better error handling and informative error messages to improve the user experience.
